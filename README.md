# Skyscraper-Puzzle-Solver
solves these puzzles: https://www.puzzle-skyscrapers.com/
rn all i have is the variant that solves the weekly one. my next goal is to be able to custom set the puzzle size. after that, maybe convert this to javascript so i can implement it in a userscript
aside from that i should probably clean up the code and actually have it parse console inputs
it's probably pretty shitty code but idc. and if u do you can suck upon my pussy like its a purple push pop
